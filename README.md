# Calculator
# Calculator Application

## Overview

This project is a simple web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator interface includes numeric buttons, operator buttons, a decimal point button, and functionality to clear the input or calculate the result.

## Features

- **Numeric Input**: Buttons for digits 0-9.
- **Operators**: Buttons for addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Decimal Point**: Button for adding a decimal point (`.`) to numbers.
- **Evaluation**: Button for evaluating the expression and displaying the result (`=`).
- **Clear**: Button to clear the current input (`C`).

## User Interface

The user interface consists of:
- A display area that shows the current input or result.
- A grid of buttons for digits, operators, and additional functions.

## How It Works

- Users can click on the numeric buttons to input numbers.
- Users can click on operator buttons to select an arithmetic operation.
- The `=` button evaluates the current expression and displays the result.
- The `C` button clears the current input, allowing users to start a new calculation.
- The calculator ensures safe arithmetic operations without using the `eval()` function.
